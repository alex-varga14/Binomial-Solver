# Binomial Solver
 Pricing Options and Derivatives using Binomial Method
-------
### Black Scholes Model
- The price of the underlying instrument is a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility
- It is possible to short sell the underlying stock
- There are no riskless arbitrage opportunities
- Trading in the stock is continuous
- There are no txn costs
- All securities are perfectly divisible 
- The risk free interest rate is constant, and it has the same value for all maturity dates.
### Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)
- Interested in one-factor European call and put options based on single asset S
- The value of S changes w.r.t to the SDE.
- Thus asset price behavior is determined by a Geometric Brownian Motion.
#### Main Software Requirements
1. Implemented using a set of inter-connected classes each with their own respective functionality.
2. Possible to choose between a number of models for generating values for the forward induction phase (CRR, TRG...).
3. Ability to define flexible payoff functions, create put or calls.
